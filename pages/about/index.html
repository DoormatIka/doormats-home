		<h2>who?</h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I'm <span style="color: var(--color-secondary);">doormat</span>, a 20 year old studying Computer Science!
			I would show you my Github but I'll get ultra-doxxed...
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I enjoy programming and often do it as a hobby. 
			I like getting into hard projects, but in recent times, I've calmed down with all of that..
