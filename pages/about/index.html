		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I'm <span style="color: var(--color-secondary);">yuyuqk</span>, a 20 year old studying Computer Science!
		</p>
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			For a while, <span class="light-color small-text">(a week)</span>, I've been browsing Neocities.
			There are so so so many good websites in this site, it's insane!
			I wonder how people do avant-garde or "core" designs over here.
			One of them even had a cool cube that was made in pure divs and JS.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Anyways, more about me. 
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I <b>try</b> not to post any personal information about me, however I'll be posting life experiences in this.
			I'm similar to most CS people. Likes anime, programming, photography, staying inside...
			I'm a very shy person too. You can talk to me in Discord though! <span style="color: cadetblue;">@yuyuqk</span>
		</p>
		<p class="light-color small-text">I should really go outside more.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I do side projects most of the time, mostly related to programming. 
			University work bores me to death.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="small-text light-color">this is my first website without the help of UI frameworks, i hope it looks good!</p>
